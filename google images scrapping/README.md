# Setting Up Google Cloud API and Programmable Search Engine

## Google Cloud API Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and sign in or create a new account if you haven't already.
2. After signing in, click on the "**Console**" button at the top right.
3. In the left slide menu, navigate to "**APIs & Services**" and then click on "**Credentials**."
4. If you don't have any credentials created yet, click on "**Create credentials**" and select the appropriate option based on your use case. For example, if you're accessing the APIs from a web server, choose "**API key**." Wait for the key to be generated, and then copy it.

## Obtaining the Search Engine ID

1. Go to [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all).
2. If you're not logged in, you might need to sign in.
3. Click on "**Create a custom search engine**."
4. Follow the instructions to create your custom search engine. You can specify the websites you want to search or select "**Search the entire web**."
5. Once your custom search engine is created, you'll be redirected to the control panel.
6. Copy the **Search Engine ID**.

Now, you can use the obtained API key and Search Engine ID in your code.
