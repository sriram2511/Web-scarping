Let's begin:
Go to Google Cloud visit this https://cloud.google.com/  and sign in or create a new account if you haven't already.
After signing in, click on the "Console" button at the top right.
In the left slide menu, navigate to "APIs & Services" and then click on "Credentials."
If you don't have any credentials created yet, click on "Create credentials" and select the appropriate option based on your use case. For example, if you're accessing the APIs from a web server, choose "API key." Wait for the key to be generated, and then copy it.

Now, let's obtain the Search Engine ID:

Go to Google Programmable Search Engine. (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all) 
If you're not logged in, you might need to sign in.
Click on "Create a custom search engine."
Follow the instructions to create your custom search engine. You can specify the websites you want to search or select "Search the entire web."
Once your custom search engine is created, you'll be redirected to the control panel.
Copy the Search Engine ID.
Now, you can use the obtained API key and Search Engine ID in your code
